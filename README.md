## Store Update

```
aeconfig update
```
This should be needed once at the install, and everytime you want to update promotional cashback information - the links to the stores are the same, but the subtitle data with cashback information may be dated if this is not run regularly

## Logo Update

```
aeconfig logos
```
This should be needed once at the install, and everytime you want to update store logos

## Show Stores and Links

```
ae [:fav|:prm] <query>
```
This will allow you to search for any store - and will show matching stores as well as the cashback information. If a store is running a promotional elevated cashback, it will be denoted by a üèÜ symbol, and will shows the regular cashback information as well. Favorite stores are denoted by ‚ù§Ô∏è

Clicking takes you directly to the site, assuming you are logged into https://aadvantageeshopping.com, else you will be prompted to login before you go to site

Shift clicking an item sets it as a favorite store, or unsets as favorite

Adding :fav to the query will limit results to favorited stores

Adding :prm to the query will limit results to stores that have a promotional rebate level


## Reinitialize

```
aeconfig reinit
```
This should only be needed if you ever want to start again for whatever reason - removes all API keys, devices, scenes, etc.

## Update

```
aeconfig workflow:update
```
An update notification should show up when an update is available, but if not invoking this should update the workflow to latest version on github
